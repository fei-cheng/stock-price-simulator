# Stock Price Simulator

This is an example project of:
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [Python multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing)
- [Azure Batch Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-technical-overview)
- [Monte Carlo Simulation](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte-Carlo-Simulation)

The simulation result might be not good as it is actually not the real focus of this project.
